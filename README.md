# OOP-Guessing-Game
A word phrase guessing game using object oriented plain JavaScript.

Using the onscreen keyboard provided, guessing a letter will either display the letter in the phrase and mark the key green if that letter is in the phrase or it will mark the key red and you lose a life. You get 5 lives before the game is over. There is a hint available about the nature of the phrase.

I added an animation to the "Start Game" button, added the option to reveal a hint on the game page, and customized the color scheme of the overlay, header, displayed phrase, and keyboard keys when clicked. I created 7 phrases to choose from for the game.
